**Automated Exam Paper Answering Using Python and Google Gemini**    A Python automation project that processes mixed-type exam papers using Google Gemini. It generates answers and exports them to Word documents, following a structured file naming convention.

**Project Title:**
Automated Exam Paper Answering Using Python and Google Gemini

**Description:**
This project showcases a Python-based automation system that leverages Google Gemini to answer 
mixed-type exam papers, including multiple-choice, essay, and other question formats. The system processes exam papers in PDF format, prompts Google Gemini for answers, and transfers the responses into a Word document. Each output file is named according to a structured naming convention, appending "_ANSWERS" to the original file name. This project demonstrates proficiency in automation, file handling, and API integration.

**Key Features:**

Automation: Batch processing of exam papers.
AI Integration: Uses Google Gemini to generate accurate answers.
File Handling: Converts and exports answers to Word documents.
Naming Convention: Ensures clear file identification for each processed exam paper.
This project highlights my skills in Python programming, AI tool integration, and automation of document workflows.
